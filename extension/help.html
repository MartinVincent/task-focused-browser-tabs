<h1>Task-focused browser tabs extension</h1>
<h2>About...</h2>
<h4>Help</h4>
<p>This extension will manage all tabs located on the right-hand side of this tab.</p>
<p>Double-click on any task and all tabs URLs that were saved for this task will be reopened.</p>
<p>When closing a task or switching to another one, then the URLs of all open tabs (and their order) will be
    memorized.</p>
<p>All tabs that are not in this windows and on the right of this one are not affected.</p>
<p>This extension will try to move to the left (that is, out of the way) all new tabs that might appear when
    opening links outside browser (e.g. clicking on a link in an email). Just move any tab to the right to
    make it part of current active task.</p>
